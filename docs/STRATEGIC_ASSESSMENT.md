# Strategic Assessment

## Does it solve the problem?
Partially. It creates a governance frame for AI-assisted work, but current automation quality undermines trust.

## SWOT
- **Strengths:** Simple GitHub-native model; low overhead; auditable decisions.
- **Weaknesses:** Fragile workflow implementation; poor scale semantics.
- **Opportunities:** Formal state machine and policy-as-code.
- **Threats:** Automation-induced churn; false operational confidence.

## Phase 3 Priorities
1. Reliability hardening.
2. Policy formalization.
3. Observability and operational excellence.
