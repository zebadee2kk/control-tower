# Documentation Audit

## Observations
- Core docs exist but production operations are under-specified.
- No single "first 30 minutes" onboarding checklist.
- Testing strategy documentation is fragmented.

## Missing Content
- Incident response examples.
- Label state transition diagram.
- Security ownership model and review cadence.
