# Workflows

Automation configurations and GitHub Actions (future).

## Current State

**v1:** No automation yet. Structure first.

## Planned Automations

### Phase 2
- Label management automation
- Budget tracking via issue comments
- Decision Desk creation reminder
- Stale issue detection

### Phase 3
- Local LLM decision cockpit integration
- Agent collaboration via MCP
- Automatic research handoffs
- Cost tracking dashboard

## Principles

1. Automate only after manual process is proven
2. Every automation must have a kill switch
3. Humans approve, machines execute
4. Log everything for audit

**Do not add workflows until operating model is stable.**
